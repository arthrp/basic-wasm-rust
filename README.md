# basic-wasm-rust [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arthrp/basic-wasm-rust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arthrp/basic-wasm-rust)
Extremely simple example of using functions written in Rust from JS via WebAssembly. This is pure Rust and pure wasm, no frameworks or "glue" JS files.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Rust and *wasm32-unknown-unknown* toolchain
2. Run build.sh
3. Run index.html from browser that supports running wasm from filesystem (Firefox)
